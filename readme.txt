## 1. **Project Description**

### **Gameplay:**
Bouncing Laser and Ball Tower Defence is a survival game where you control a polygon defending against waves of balls. Armed with a bouncing laser, your goal is to clear waves, collect power-ups, and avoid getting hit. With limited health, every move counts.

You play as a polygon in the center of the screen, defending against waves of balls. Your only weapon is a laser, which you can fire by left-clicking. The twist: the laser bounces off walls, allowing you to hit balls from different angles.

To win, you must clear all waves of balls. Along the way, you can upgrade your stats via the upgrade menu or by shooting special buff balls that appear.

Your health is limited to just 3 points. If you get hit three times, it's game over.
