Bouncing Laser and Ball Tower Defence
inspired by "The Tower"
by Munyin Sam 6710545962

Gameplay:
A survival game where you control a polygon defending against waves of balls. 
Armed with a bouncing laser, you must clear the waves, collect power-ups, and avoid getting hit. 
With limited health, every move counts.

You play as a polygon in the middle of the screen, trying to survive waves of balls coming your way. 
Your only weapon is a laser that you can shoot by left-clicking. 
The twist? The laser bounces, so you can use it to hit balls from different angles.

To win, you'll need to clear all the waves of balls. As you play, you can upgrade your stats through 
the upgrade menu or by shooting special buff balls that appear.

Your health is limited to just 3 points. If you get hit three times, it's game over.
